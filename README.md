# Hangman 

A simple hangman TUI to teach myself Rust.

## Run
To compile, first make sure you have [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) installed.
With cargo installed, clone the repository.
From the repository's root directory, run `cargo run` to build and run, or `cargo build` to build, and `./target/debug/hangman` to run.
